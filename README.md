# Kovalenko photography

Kovalenko photography is a website that will help people find a professional photographer for their photo shoot. The site will be targeted toward people who want to capture different moments and events of their lives in photographs.

## Technologies

1. Balsamiq - to create a wireframe.
2. HTML - to create a basic site.
3. CSS - to create front-end and to give a great user experience.
4. GitHub - source code hosting and deployment.

## UX

### Strategy
Since this is my first software project, I chose to create a simple photography services website. This website will allow the photographer to attract potential clients.

### Scope
For users interested in photography services, I wanted to introduce them to a professional photographer. The website contains information about what services are provided and examples of work. And also allows you to stay in touch.

### Structure
Website pages:
1. Home page: contains introduction section and services section.
2. Gallery page: allows to select three different gallery albums. 
3. Gallery wedding/Gallery newborn/Gallery family: contains relevant photos.
4. About page: information about the photographer.
5. Contact page: allows user to stay in touch.

All pages have a header that allows you to navigate to different pages from any place and a footer that contains links to the photographer's social media.  

### Skeleton
The website is designed to be clear and simple. To create a wireframe I used Balsamiq software. PDF file with my wireframe you cand find [here](/readme_images/wireframe_kovalenko_photography.pdf).

### Surface
To prevent the site from being too cluttered, I used a palette of only three colours.

![Palette](/readme_images/Colour_palette.png)

For the contact page I selected an image that consists of similar shades of color that I used for the content.

### Features Left to Implement

### Fixed Bugs

 - When zoomed out on the contact page on larger screens, the background image did not completely fill the screen.

 ![Unfixed background on Contact page](readme_images/Unfixed_back_Contact.png)

  To solve this problem, the width property was applied with a value of 100% for screens larger than 992 px.
